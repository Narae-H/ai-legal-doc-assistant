# Key Takeaways

## Lesson 1: Introduction
This lesson introduces **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and how to use them effectively via API.

### Comparison: Base LLM vs. Instruction-Tuned LLM
|                    | **Base LLM**                          | **Instruction-Tuned LLM**                                     |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Description**    | Predicts the next word based on training data | Fine-tuned to follow instructions using RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) |
| **Features**       | —                                     | Helpful, Honest, Harmless                                     |
| **Usage**          | More raw, requires detailed prompting | More practical for real-world applications, easier to use safely |
- This course focuses on **Instruction-Tuned LLMs**, which are more reliable and commonly used in production systems.

### Key Insight:
When using instruction-tuned LLMs, if the model doesn’t give the desired output, it’s often because the **prompt wasn't clear or specific enough**.  
To improve results, write instructions **as if you were explaining to a new graduate or someone unfamiliar with the topic.**
